This repository documents the design and planning of an enterprise network redesign for a fictional medical supply distribution company, developed as part of an Information Systems Capstone project. 
This project focuses on building a secure, scalable, and compliant network architecture, incorporating VLAN segmentation, firewall security, VPN remote access for the Sales Team, and hybrid cloud/on-prem infrastructure. Emphasis was placed on protecting sensitive data, secure data storage as required by governing bodies, supporting remote users, and ensuring operational resilience through redundancy and backup planning. 
Included are logical and physical network diagrams, security policy recommendations, traffic flow analysis, cost and vendor comparisons, and a phased implementation plan. The project demonstrates applied skills in network design, security fundamentals, technical documentation, and IT project planning, aligned with real-world enterprise requirements.
